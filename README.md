Calculate AUC-ROC using trapezoidal integration with integer arithmetic
Copyright (c) Bo Yang 2025

I wrote this code many years ago. Recently I came across it, and asked
Grok 3 AI to check it for issues. I'm glad to say Grok didn't find any
real issues. I asked Grok to generate some documentation and here it is.

Source Files:

  * calc_auc.cpp : main cpp file implementing AUC calculation
  * calc_auc.h : header file for calc_auc.cpp
  * test_calc_auc.cpp : test program for calc_auc.cpp and calc_auc.h

Test data files:
  
  * test_files/*.txt

Visual Studio solution and project files:

  * calc_auc.sln
  * calc_auc_test.vcxproj
  * calc_auc_test.vcxproj.filters
